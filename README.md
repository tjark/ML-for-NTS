# Modal Logics for Nominal Transition Systems

These Isabelle theories formalize a modal logic for nominal transition
systems, as presented in the paper

  *Modal Logics for Nominal Transition Systems*

by Joachim Parrow, Johannes Borgstr√∂m, Lars-Henrik Eriksson,
Ram&#363;nas Gutkovas, and Tjark Weber.

These theories are known to work with
[Isabelle2015](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/)
and the corresponding version of
[Nominal2](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/nominal/download.html).

Assuming both Isabelle2015 and Nominal2 are installed, the theories
may be processed as usual: for instance, in batch mode by executing

  `/path/to/Isabelle2015/bin/isabelle build -d /path/to/Nominal2/ -D .`

or interactively in Isabelle/jEdit by executing, e.g.,

  `/path/to/Isabelle2015/bin/isabelle jedit -d /path/to/Nominal2/ -l Nominal2 Equivalence_Implies_Bisimilarity.thy`
